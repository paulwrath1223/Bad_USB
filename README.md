# Bad_USB
A PCB for a bad USB based on Malduino W, but with a built in hub to allow for use as a real USB stick

The main components are an ESP8266, an ARM Comtex M0, a USB hub controller, and a readily available USB stick. The USB stick is not in the scematic because it will be soldered on to pads with wires in order to save space by stacking.
